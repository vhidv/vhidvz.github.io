WorkflowJS is a lightweight and flexible library for building workflows and processes with NodeJS. It allows you to define processes using BPMN 2.0.

This is a JavaScript library for building and executing workflows. It provides a simple, declarative syntax for defining processes, and offers a flexible and extensible framework for handling workflow events and activities.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @vhidvz/wfjs
```

## Getting Started

### Define a BPMN Schema

To define a BPMN schema, you need to create a file with the extension `.bpmn` and define the schema using the BPMN 2.0 standard or use the online BPMN [editor](https://demo.bpmn.io/new). Here's an example of a simple BPMN schema:

> The full definition of the simple workflow schema `.bpmn` file located in [this link](https://github.com/vhidvz/workflow-js/tree/master/example).

### Creating a Workflow Instance

To create a new workflow, you need to define a class with methods that represent the different steps of the workflow. You can use decorators to define the nodes and activities of the workflow. Here's an example of a simple workflow:

```ts
import { Act, Node, Process, EventActivity } from '@vhidvz/wfjs';

@Process({ name: 'Simple Workflow' })
class SimpleWorkflow {
  @Node({ name: 'Start' })
  public start(@Act() activity: EventActivity) {
    activity.takeOutgoing();
  }
}
```

### Building and Executing the Workflow

Once you have defined the workflow, you can build and execute it using the WorkflowJS library. Here's how you can do it:

```ts
import { parse, readFile, WorkflowJS } from '@vhidvz/wfjs';

const workflow = WorkflowJS.build();

const xml = readFile('./example/simple-workflow.bpmn');

const { context } = workflow.execute({
  factory: () => new SimpleWorkflow(),
  schema: parse(xml)['bpmn:definitions'],
});

console.debug('\nContext is:', JSON.stringify(context.serialize(), null, 2));
```
