WorkflowJS is a lightweight and flexible library for building workflows and processes with NodeJS. It allows you to define processes using BPMN 2.0.

This is a JavaScript library for building and executing workflows. It provides a simple, declarative syntax for defining processes, and offers a flexible and extensible framework for handling workflow events and activities.

```

## Concepts

| * | Concept  | Description                                                      | Type   | Decorator | Required |
|---|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Process  | is a BPMN lane, a collection of flow objects.                    | Class  | @Process  | Yes      |
| 2 | Node     | is a functionality of `Activity` in a workflow.                  | Method | @Node     | Yes      |
| 3 | Activity | is a Flow Object or a Node of a workflow process.                | Param  | @Act()    | Yes      |
| 4 | Context  | is storing the state of the machine during execution.            | Param  | @Ctx()    | No       |
| 5 | Token    | has a `history` of the execution `State`, tokens are needed.     | Param  | @Sign()   | No       |
| 6 | history  | is an array of the `State` of a flow object or node in a token.  | --     | @Sign()   | No       |
| 7 | State    | it contains the state of each node or flows object in `history`. | --     | @Sign()   | No       |
| 8 | Data     | is a shared space across the execution context.                  | Param  | @Data()   | Maybe    |
| 9 | Value    | is an isolated space for each flow object or node.               | Param  | @Value()  | Maybe    |

> Note: if you `return` a value in a `Node` the value is passed to the next available `Node` as a `Value` in a specific execution.

## Getting Started

### Define a BPMN Schema

To define a BPMN schema, you need to create a file with the extension `.bpmn` and define the schema using the BPMN 2.0 standard or use the online BPMN [editor](https://demo.bpmn.io/new). Here's an example of a simple BPMN schema:

![Simple Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vhidvz/workflow-js/master/assets/simple-workflow.svg)

> The full definition of the simple workflow schema `.bpmn` file located in [this link](https://github.com/vhidvz/workflow-js/tree/master/example).

### Creating a Workflow Instance

To create a new workflow, you need to define a class with methods that represent the different steps of the workflow. You can use decorators to define the nodes and activities of the workflow. Here's an example of a simple workflow:

```ts
import { Act, Node, Process } from "@vhidvz/wfjs/common";
import { EventActivity } from "@vhidvz/wfjs/core";

@Process({ name: 'Simple Workflow' })
class SimpleWorkflow {
  @Node({ name: 'Start' })
  async start(@Act() activity: EventActivity) {
    activity.takeOutgoing();
  }
}
```

### Building and Executing the Workflow

Once you have defined the workflow, you can build and execute it using the WorkflowJS library. Here's how you can do it:

```ts
import { parse, readFile, WorkflowJS } from '@vhidvz/wfjs';

(async () => {
  const workflow = WorkflowJS.build();

  const { context } = await workflow.execute({
    factory: () => new SimpleWorkflow(),
    xml: readFile('./example/simple-workflow.bpmn'),
  });

  console.debug('\nContext is:', JSON.stringify(context.serialize(), null, 2));
})()
```
