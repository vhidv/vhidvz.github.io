# What's ABAC?

> WIKIPEDIA: Attribute-based access control (ABAC), also known as policy-based access control for IAM, defines an access control paradigm whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of policies which combine attributes together. The policies can use any type of attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, object, environment attributes etc)[^1].

Attributes can be fall into 4 different categories:

- Policy attributes: attributes that describe the user attempting the access e.g. role, job title
- Action attributes: attributes that describe the action being attempted e.g. create, read, delete, update
- Subject attributes: attributes that describe the object (or resource) being accessed e.g. the object type (medical record, bank account)
- Contextual (environment) attributes: attributes that deal with time, location or dynamic aspects of the access control scenario
